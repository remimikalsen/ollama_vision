# Ollama Vision ~2

This is a copy of the origional [Ollama Vision](https://github.com/remimikalsen/ollama_vision) with the intent at this time to allow for multiple image files being sent to the LLM. I have specifically renamed it to ollama vision 2, as to not interfere with the version of ollama vision that is already installed.

# Changes

Image_url: now accepts multiple "path"s

Default LLM: [antony66/gemma3-tools:27b](https://ollama.com/antony66/gemma3-tools:27b)

DEFAULT_TEXT_MODEL = "antony66/gemma3-tools:27b"


# Installation and Troubleshooting

Remimikalsen has done a great job of the origional
